This program requires some additional material provided in Source. I borrowed elements from proived materials in the example codes of course website.
To run the program just open up google chrome and drag and drop sierpinski.html file.
EDIT: -Removed Colorbuffer.Now utilizes uniform vec4
      -Added comments and header comment that includes my name and other info
      -Expanded canvas to be 1500 to 600
      -Adjusted Mouse down and up values for vertex locations
